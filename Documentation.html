    <h2>LDU Factorization</h2>
    <p>LDU Factorization is a method of decomposing a square matrix of any dimension into product of three matrices.
        <br>
        <li> L - A Lower triangular matrix where ones(1) as diagonal elements. </li>
        <li> D - A Diagonal matrix </li>
        <li> U - An Upper triangular matrix </li>
    <br>
    It represented as A = L * D * U
    </p>
